LAB:    Getting Started with App Engine

NOTE
">>" SIGNIFIES THE BEGINNING OF A NEW TASK &
"**" SIGNIFIES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION


>>      Overview
        In this lab, you create and deploy a simple App Engine application using a virtual environment in the Google 
        Cloud Shell


>>      Objectives
        In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:
(1)     Initialize App Engine.
(2)     Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.
(3)     Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.
(4)     Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

>> pre_Task 1: 
a)      Sign in to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console using the credentials that was provided for you
b)      list the active account name

              gcloud auth list


d)      list the project ID

              gcloud config list project

>> Task 1: 
a)      Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region

                gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

        ** When prompted, select the region where you want your App Engine application located

b)      Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory
        
                git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

c)      Navigate to the source directory

                cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

>> Task 2: 
        In this task, you run the Hello World application in a local, virtual environment in Cloud Shell
a)      download and update the packages list

                sudo apt-get update

b)      Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application to isolate package installations from the system

                sudo apt-get install virtualenv

        ** If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter

                virtualenv -p python3 venv

c)      Activate the virtual environment

                source venv/bin/activate

d)      Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies

                pip install  -r requirements.txt

e)      Run the application

                python main.py

        ** Please ignore the warning if any
        ** press Ctrl+C to abort the deployed service

>> Task 3: 
        Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine
a)     Navigate to the source directory

                cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

b)      Deploy your Hello World application

                gcloud app deploy
        
        ** If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter

c)      Launch your browser to view the app http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com

                gcloud app browse

>> Task 4: 
a)      Disable the application

        ** disabling an app engine application can only be done through the google cloud console, there is 
        ** no command for implementing it as at now.
